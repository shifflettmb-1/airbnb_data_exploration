# Overview

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects hosts offering short-to-long-term stays, experiences, and services with guests worldwide. The company operates on a peer-to-peer model, allowing individuals to rent out a wide variety of properties like private rooms, entire houses or apartments, and even unique spaces like castles. Airbnb allows hosts to set their price, availability, decide whether to rent their whole home or just a single room as well as decide on what listing name they want for their property. This exploration is for educational purposes only and meant to see what can be discovered through diving deeper into the data.

The dataset was pulled from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/data) and contains information of close to 50,000 hosts during the 2019 calendar year. The analysis is based on data collected from the public Airbnb platform that is verified, aggregated and publicly available.

# Questions

* What factors would make an AirBnB location have the highest chance to be the most profitable?
* If I’m new to being an airbnb host or wanted to become on, how should I go about setting my price, choosing my listing?
* What is a realistic number of bookings that I can expect per month?

# Visualization

There were three main focuses I had for this project. I wanted to see how listing name played apart in how likely the Airbnb would be to be booked (reviewed), how to determine an appropriate price for listing based on the market, and finally if I could display this data on a map to see what hidden geographical influences played a part in success of these hosts.

For my visualization I wanted to look deeper at the top performers in the dataset, the listings that were in the top ten percent of total number of reviews as well as the top ten percent of monthly reviews. Comparisons also needed to be geographically based, meaning I'm taking the data and breaking it down into the top performers by region to see results. There were five distinct regions for this exploration which included the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.

## Listing

When analysizing the listing names of the properties I decided that common conjunctions and prepositions may not be too relevant for this context so I decided to remove them from the results.
